# OSC_to_Peavey_Xframe_88_Relay
 
 
This Project was built back in 2012 to pair newer technology and Ipad with the controls system for much older hardware the Peavey Xframe 88 Specifically.   This code currently runs the audio controls of several local bars in Las Vegas.    It has been extremly stable and never needed bug fixes.  I personally havent looked at the code in a few years and only had to send a full flash of the raspberry pi SD card with the software preinstalled a couple of times.   SD card corruption about once a year was the only problem this faced.   Code wasn't really the most abstracted and was done in a jam session for some extra operating cash.
